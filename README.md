# Traffic-Lane-Vehicle-Counter-Project
This project is a Traffic Flow Counter that uses a pre-trained YOLO model with DeepSORT tracking to detect, classify, and count vehicles in multiple lanes from video footage. It outputs an annotated video and a CSV file containing vehicle ID, type, lane, frame, and timestamp for traffic analysis.
